## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to use events to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript, but later switched to jQuery for speed. I also learned how to create prototypes in JavaScript, although I no longer needed to use them thanks to jQuery.

you just have to do:
```js
HTMLElement.prototype.close=function(){
  return this.style.display=='none';
}
```

And call the close method
```js
  document.getElementById('ID_ELEMENT').close();
```


### Continued development

These notions learned on prototypes will help me to create my own methods to easily manipulate the DOM.
I want to find a way to no longer depend on any library.
